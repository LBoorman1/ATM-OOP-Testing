# ATM-OOP-Testing
Basic coding challenge based around finding remaining quantities of notes after withdrawing from an ATM.

# Map implementation
Started with a hash map but remembered about the ordering of keys.
Looked up a solution and found TreeMap which allows the ordering of keys in descending order using the Comparator.
